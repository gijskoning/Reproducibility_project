# Reproducibility project
This repository is an assignment of the Deep Learning course given by the TUDelft.
It reproduces the paper "Influence-aware Memory Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning" written by Miguel Suau ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07643)).
The code for the original paper was developed in Tensorflow ([link](https://github.com/INFLUENCEorg/influence-aware-memory)).  This project recreates it in Pytorch and has some additional experiments and evaluations. 

Currently, the code is a work in progress and is only a not working copy of the tensorflow one.
